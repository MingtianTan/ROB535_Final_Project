# ROB535_Final_Projectï¼š Competitive Convolution-Free Transformers for Image Classification
Student Name: Haoran Gao, Mingtian Tan
In this project, we adopted the file from the state-of-art method for image classification, which the original work is from:
Swin-Transformer: https://github.com/microsoft/Swin-Transformer;
Deit: https://github.com/facebookresearch/deit;
Regnet: https://github.com/signatrix/regnet;
By comparing their results in tests for RegularImageNet-1Ktrainedmodels, we conclude the advantages and disadvantages of three networks and introduce detailed information for each network.
The dataset we use to test is "ImageNet (ILSVRC) 2012", which is downloaded via the address: https://image-net.org/download.php
